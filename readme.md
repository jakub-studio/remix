# Remix Icebreaker
Remix is a an icebreaker app where the participants have to guess who was the submitter of a song. The host can choose a theme such as "What is a song you don't expect people you to listen to?" or "What's your favourite song ever?". Remix is powered by Spotify and requires a Spotify Premium subscription to use.

### Work-In-Progress
Please note this project is currently work-in-progress. Whilst it works and someone who can get the development environment set-up is able to run it, I am currently working to make this more end-user friendly and approved by Spotify. You can monitor progress for the V1 release [here](https://github.com/jakub-studio/remix/pull/2). Apologies for the inconvience.
